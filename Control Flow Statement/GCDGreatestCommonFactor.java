//Q-> Write a method named getGreatestCommonDivisor with two parameters of type int named first and second.
//    If one of the parameters is < 10, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
//    The method should return the greatest common divisor of the two numbers (int).
//    The greatest common divisor is the largest positive integer that can fully divide each of the integers
//    (i.e. without leaving a remainder).

//     For example 12 and 30:
//     12 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
//     30 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30

//     The greatest common divisor is 6 since both 12 and 30 can be divided by 6, and there is no resulting remainder.

//     EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
//     getGreatestCommonDivisor(25, 15); should return 5 since both can be divided by 5 without a remainder
//     getGreatestCommonDivisor(12, 30); should return 6 since both can be divided by 6 without a remainder
//     getGreatestCommonDivisor(9, 18); should return -1 since the first parameter is < 10
//     getGreatestCommonDivisor(81, 153); should return 9 since both can be divided by 9 without a remainder
